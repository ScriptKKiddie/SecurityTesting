a,Reflected XSS-,Stored XSS,DOM XSS
Value reflection,Value is not stored in database but instead from a GET or POST parameter,Value is stored in database and gotten from there,Value gets put into DOM Sink
Test objectives,"Identify where a value is stored into the DB and reflected back onto the page + Assess the input they accept and see if we
can't pass around any filters","Identify where a value is reflected into the response + Assess the input they accept and see if we
can't pass around any filters","Identify where a value is put into a DOM sink and reflected back onto the page + Assess the input they accept and see if we
can't pass around any filters"
Step 1,Detect input vectors by testing ALL parameters,Detect input vectors by testing ALL parameters,Static code review works best for this
Step 2,Analyse the results depending on the context,Analyse the results depending on the context,"Find the DOM sinks by entering a random value and looking at the developer console, try to find the value where it is reflected and the context"
Step 3,Check impact of attack vector,Check impact of attack vector,Attacker MUST use developer console and not inspect source as that will not show DOM elements
