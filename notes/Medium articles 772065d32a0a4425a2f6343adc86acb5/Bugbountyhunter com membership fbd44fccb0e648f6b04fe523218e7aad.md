# Bugbountyhunter.com membership

Hello Amazing hackers

I Hope you are all doing well today!

First of all i would like to extend a big thank you to [bugbountyhunter.com](http://bugbountyhunter.com) for making this video possible. I Recently had the chance to try out their premium membership and i am in love. 

Let’s go over some of the features the website has to offer and show you what you can expect for your fee, i promise you will not be disappointed.

The first thing i want to talk about is Sean’s methodology. He doesn’t just talk about what vulnerabilities to look for but also how he looks for them and what makes a parameter suspicious. Besides all of this he also helps you with the more practical issues of bug bounties such as picking a good target that fits you and report writing. As an expierenced bug bounty hunter, i can personally vouch for his methodology. It looks very similar to mine and besides that, i learned quite a lot from just reading the PDF.

Now this may seem sweet but I promise you that it’s just the tip of the iceberg. What [bugbountyhunter.com](http://bugbountyhunter.com) offers as well is a web application called Barker. Barker is developed with vulnerabilities built into it that are based on real vulnerabilities from real targets. Again, as a bug bounty hunter i can confirm these issues are very lifelike and look exactly like what i would find when hunting in the wild. On top of the existing vulnerabilities, Barker is updated regularly with cool new vulnerabilities.

Besides the fact that Barker is amazing, there is also a real reporting system. You can actually report the issues you find and they will be triaged like they would be in a real life scenario. This not only helps you with finding issues but also with improving your reporting which in my opinion is the most important skill a hunter could have because if you can’t prove that there is a vulnerability, you won’t get rewarded or it will take a considerably longer time.

As if all of this was not enough yet, you also get lifetime access to the bugbountyhunter discord and the possibility to join hacking fridays. Full disclosure though, you need to submit 25 valid bugs and level up to join the hacking fridays but it’s totally worth it and should not take you long at all if you follow the methodology. Hacking Fridays is where the group focusses on a chosen target and exchange idea’s while splitting the bounty. 

To finish up and answer your question whether or not [bugbountyhunter.com](http://bugbountyhunter.com) membership is worth it? YES! For that price you get a full methodology, a simulated target to practice on, a real reporting system and you get to hack with the pro’s... 100% recommended for the money.
